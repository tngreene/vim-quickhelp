Vim Tropes - Mode Prefixes

(from *map-listing*)

      CHAR	MODE	~
     <Space>	Normal, Visual, Select and Operator-pending
	n	Normal
	v	Visual and Select
	s	Select
	x	Visual
	o	Operator-pending
	!	Insert and Command-line
	i	Insert
	l	":lmap" mappings for Insert, Command-line and Lang-Arg
	c	Command-line

Just before the {rhs} a special character can appear:
	*	indicates that it is not remappable
	&	indicates that only script-local mappings are remappable
	@	indicates a buffer-local mapping

Everything from the first non-blank after {lhs} up to the end of the line
(or '|') is considered to be part of {rhs}.  This allows the {rhs} to end
with a space.

Note: When using mappings for Visual mode, you can use the "'<" mark, which
is the start of the last selected Visual area in the current buffer |'<|.

The |:filter| command can be used to select what mappings to list.  The
pattern is matched against the {lhs} and {rhs} in the raw form.
