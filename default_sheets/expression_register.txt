The Expression Register
=======================



The expression must evaluate to a string. Numbers are automatically converted.
For a p or ":put" command, floats are converted into a string. If the result
is a list, each is converted into a string and used as a line, split on <NL>
characters. If it ends in a <NL> it is regared as a line wise register.
