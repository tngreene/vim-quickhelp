*spell.txt*	For Vim version 8.0.  Last change: 2016 Jan 08

===============================================================================

1. Quick start					*spell-quickstart* *E756*

This switches on the 'spell' option. spelllang is optional.

	:setlocal spell

Spell checking wraps around file when 'wrapscan' is on.

Searching for misspelled words

Spellrotate (normal, visual)
zn	spell rotate forward
zp	spell rotate backward

Command		Action						Finds
[count]]s	Move to [count] next misspelled word after the cursor	Bad, rare words
[count]]S	Move to next misspelled word after the cursor	Bad words

[count][s	Move to next misspelled word before the cursor	Bad, rare words
[count][S	Move to next misspelled word before the cursor	Bad words

							*[s*
[count][s		Like "]s" but search backwards, find the misspelled
			word before the cursor.  Doesn't recognize words
			split over two lines. Does not stop at word with
			missing capital at the start of a line.

Add words as good 
-----------------
Command	spellfile
zg	'spellfile'
zG	|internal-wordlist|

Add words as bad
------------------
Command	spellfile
zw	'spellfile'
zW	|internal-wordlist|

Undo addition/remove added words
Command	spellfile
zug/w	'spellfile'
zuG/W	||internal-wordlist|

[count] with zg,zug/zuw/zuG/zuW	A count may precede the command
				to indicate the entry in 'spellfile' to be used.  A
				count of two uses the second entry.

Visual mode
			In Visual mode the selected characters are added as a
			word (including white space!).
			When the cursor is on text that is marked as badly
			spelled then the marked text is used.
			Otherwise the word under the cursor, separated by
			non-word characters, is used.

Conflicts
			If the word is explicitly marked as bad word in
			another spell file the result is unpredictable.

zw			Like "zg" but mark the word as a wrong (bad) word.
			If the vord already appears in 'spellfile' it is
			turned into a comment line.  See |spellfile-cleanup|
			for getting rid of those.

Suggestions
							*z=*
z=			For the word under/after the cursor suggest correctly
			spelled words.  This also works to find alternatives
			for a word that is not highlighted as a bad word,
			e.g., when the word after it is bad.
			In Visual mode the highlighted text is taken as the
			word to be replaced.
			The results are sorted on similarity to the word being
			replaced.
			This may take a long time.  Hit CTRL-C when you get
			bored.

			If the command is used without a count the
			alternatives are listed and you can enter the number
			of your choice or press <Enter> if you don't want to
			replace.  You can also use the mouse to click on your
			choice (only works if the mouse can be used in Normal
			mode and when there are no line wraps).  Click on the
			first line (the header) to cancel.

			The suggestions listed normally replace a highlighted
			bad word.  Sometimes they include other text, in that
			case the replaced text is also listed after a "<".

			If a count is used that suggestion is used, without
			prompting.  For example, "1z=" always takes the first
			suggestion.

			"." will repeat word replacement. This works like "ciw",
			 the good word and <Esc>.

After adding a word to 'spellfile' with the above commands its associated
".spl" file will automatically be updated and reloaded.

							*internal-wordlist*
The internal word list is used for all buffers where 'spell' is set.  It is
not stored, it is lost when you exit Vim.  It is also cleared when 'encoding'
is set.
