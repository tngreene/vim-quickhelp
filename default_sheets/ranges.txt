This is called a range. Ranges xxxx[range]

Line numbers may be specified with:		*:range* *E14* *{address}*
	{number}	an absolute line number
	.		the current line			  *:.*
	$		the last line in the file		  *:$*
	%		equal to 1,$ (the entire file)		  *:%*
	't		position of mark t (lowercase)		  *:'*
	'T		position of mark T (uppercase); when the mark is in
			another file it cannot be used in a range
	/{pattern}/	the next line where {pattern} matches	  *:/*
	?{pattern}?	the previous line where {pattern} matches *:?*
	\/		the next line where the previously used search
			pattern matches
	\?		the previous line where the previously used search
			pattern matches
	\&		the next line where the previously used substitute
			pattern matches

Each specifier can be followed by '+' or '-' and an optional number, it will
change the preceding line number. If ommited, 1 is used.
