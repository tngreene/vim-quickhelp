Vim Registers
==============================================================================

								*:reg* *:registers*
:"reg[isters] {arg} Displays contents of all numbered and named registers.
With optional {arg}, only those registers are displayed. Example :reg a
displays the contents of "a, :reg 0123b displays contents of "1,"2,"3, and "b

There are ten types of registers:			*registers* *E354*
1. The unnamed register ""				*quote_quote* *quotequote*      
Filled with text deleted with "d", "c", "s", "x" or yanked with "y", regardless
of any other register specified (except the black hole register "_).
p or P uses "" by default.

2. Numbered registers "0 to "9		*quote_number* *quote0* *quote1*
					*quote2* *quote3* *quote4* *quote9*
"0 contains text from most recent yank
"1 from most recent delete or change, unless another register is specified
or delete is less than one line. It is, however, always filled when deleted
with the following movement commands |%|, |(|, |)|, |`|,
|/|, |?|, |n|, |N|, |{| and |}|. 

"2-"9, each time "1 is changed, the contents of "1 get pushed to "2, "2 to "3,
etc until the contents of "9 are lost

3. Small delete register "-				*quote_-* *quote-*
This register is filled whenever a delete command deletes less than one line
(a small change), except when another register is explicitly specified

4. Named registers "a to "z or "A to "Z			*quote_alpha* *quotea*
These are only filled as is told. Lowercase replaces, uppercase appends

5. Read-only registers ":, ". and "%

							*quote_.* *quote.* *E29*
	".	Contains last inserted text using insert commands
							*quote_%* *quote%*
	"%	Contains the name of the current file. Use %:p for full
		path, as in `expand("%:p")`

							*quote_:* *quote:* *E30*
	":	Contains most recent executed non-plugin command-line cmd

							*quote_#* *quote#*
6. Alternate file register "#
The name of the alternate file for the current window,
changing what |CTRL-^| opens

7. Expression register "=			*quote_=* *quote=* *@=*
Gets the output of an expression, as entered in the commandline,
and uses it as the value of the register. Immediately after invoking
the register (with " or *CTRL-R*) the cursor jumps to the commandline
to input it.

Result Type | Converted To String ~
------------|-------------------- ~
String      | Yes ~
Number      | Yes ~
Float       | Yes ~
List        | Each element is converted as possible, appended with <NL> ~
Dictionary  | No, must use string() first ~
FuncRef     | No, must use string() first ~

8. Selection and drop registers "*, "+ and "~ 
"* and "+ contain clipboard text. On X11 systems these may be different

						*quote_~* *quote~* *<Drop>*
"~ stores the last dropped text from a drag and drop operation

9. Black hole register "_				*quote_*
Anything written to this register is lost and no side effects occur.
Any attempts to read this register results in an empty string

10. Last search pattern register	"/			*quote_/* *quote/*
Contains the most recent search-pattern.  This is used for "n" and 'hlsearch'.
Changing `:let` does not search again. It cannot be changed with yank or delete
