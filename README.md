# vim-quickhelp
Concise (and better!) versions of vim help

# Introduction
There are lots of vim help viewers, cheatsheets, and people's favorite vim tricks but what about more useful help documents itself? There are a pleathora of tutorials and textbooks to teach beginners, but what about intermediate and advanced users who just want a concise reference to 90% they use (and 0% of the boilerplate and esoteric options no one uses)! *Also, wouldn't it be nice to have a dynamic help system that showed current values of settings and previews of command effects?*

**This project aims to provide help docs that are somewhere between cheatsheets and reference documents about common concepts, without being another *Beginners Guide to Vim*.** It also aims to add features to make help more useful and less static.

Try opening a quickhelp document next to its corresponding help document and seeing the style this is going for.

# Goals (in no particular order)
- [ ] Continue creating, writing, and refining quickhelp docs for vim
- [ ] Write quickhelp docs for common plugins, such as NERDTree and EasyAlign
- [ ] Implement preprocessor to show the values of common settings
- [ ] Create linking behavior similar the existing help system, allowing people to interact with vim-quickhelp as they do with vim's regular help

*Don't expect much for a while.*
